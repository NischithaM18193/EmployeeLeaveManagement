🧑‍🏫 **What is Clean Architecture?**
👉 It is a way to structure your project so that your business logic is independent of:
      Database
      UI
      Frameworks (ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, etc.)
      External systems (APIs, file systems)
You keep your core business rules protected from technical details.

**🎯 Why use Clean Architecture?**

1️⃣ Separation of concerns
Each layer has a clear responsibility.
UI Layer → displays info.
Application Layer → processes commands & queries.
Domain Layer → contains core business logic.
Infrastructure Layer → implements technical details (DB, APIs).

👉 Makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

2️⃣ Independent business logic
Business rules live in the Domain layer.
You can change the database, UI, or framework without touching core business logic.
Example: Move from SQL Server to MongoDB → Infrastructure changes, but Domain stays the same.

👉 Business is not tied to technology.

3️⃣ Testability
Domain Layer and Application Layer are easy to unit test because they are pure C# classes with no dependencies on frameworks.
You can mock infrastructure (DB, APIs) and test your business logic independently.

👉 Leads to better test coverage and more reliable code.

4️⃣ Flexibility
You can plug and play components.
Want to add a new API? A new UI? A background job? → Application & Domain layers remain unchanged.

👉 Helps build scalable and flexible systems.

5️⃣ Long-term Maintainability
In large projects, as codebase grows, clean architecture:
Keeps it organized.
Makes it easier for new developers to understand.
Reduces risk of breaking business logic when making infrastructure changes.

👉 Makes it suitable for enterprise-grade applications.
